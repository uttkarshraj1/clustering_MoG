# Clustering MoG

- The assignment is related to the methodologies taught in the Clustering, Mixtures of Gaussians, and classification II lectures. 

1) In this assignment  we will use the Peterson and Barneyâ€™s dataset of vowel formant frequencies.

2) You will visualise the data and fit, to each of  two of the phonemes in the dataset, a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) -- this part is related to density estimation (Tasks 1 and 2).

3) You will subsequently use the fitted MoG so as to perform a simple Bayesian classification based on the ML principle (Task 3) and visualise the corresponding decision boundary (Task 4).

4) The previous tasks are with Gaussians with diagonal covariances.

5) finally (Task  5), you will work on Gaussians with full covariance matrices.
